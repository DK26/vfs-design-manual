# Copilot Instructions

## Single Source of Truth

**AGENTS.md is the ONLY authoritative source for all design decisions, architecture patterns, and development guidelines in this repository.**

Before making ANY changes:
1. **Read AGENTS.md first** - It contains critical context about the project
2. **Follow AGENTS.md over other files** - If README.md, docs/, or archived files conflict with AGENTS.md, AGENTS.md wins
3. **Fix outdated files** - If you find conflicts, update the outdated file to match AGENTS.md

## What AGENTS.md Contains

- Project overview and architecture
- Trait hierarchy and crate structure
- Naming conventions and common mistakes
- Implementation requirements
- Critical reviewer guidelines

## Quick Reference

See the "Common Mistakes to Avoid" and "Critical: Reviewer & AI Guidelines" sections in AGENTS.md for patterns to avoid and rules to follow.
